## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:
- A [TMDb API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) (free to obtain by signing up).
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) installed (Miniconda or Anaconda).
- Git installed to clone the repository.
- A Render.com account for deployment (optional).

## Local Setup with Conda
Follow these steps to run the app locally using Conda:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-mood-ring.git
   cd movie-mood-ring
   ```

2. **Create a Conda Environment**:
   Create a new environment named `movie_mood_ring` with Python 3.9:
   ```bash
   conda create -n movie_mood_ring python=3.9
   ```

3. **Activate the Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate movie_mood_ring
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install required packages from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure `requirements.txt` includes:
   ```
   Flask
   requests
   python-dotenv
   gunicorn
   ```

5. **Set Up the TMDb API Key**:
   You can configure the API key in one of two ways:

   - **Option 1: Using a `.env` File** (Recommended):
     Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```bash
     echo "TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
     ```
     Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual TMDb API key.

   - **Option 2: Using a Command-Line Environment Variable**:
     Set the API key directly in your terminal before running the app:

     To set your TMDB API key in the command line so your Flask app can access it, use this PowerShell command before running your app:

     $env:TMDB_API_KEY = "your_actual_tmdb_api_key"

     Replace "your_actual_tmdb_api_key" with your real TMDB API key (including quotes).
     
     Then, in the same terminal session, run:
     $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
     flask run

This will ensure your app can read the API key from the environment.


6. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Or, use Python directly:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
